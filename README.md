<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Linus Cheng</h1> 

# 🤖 💻 About Me:
I am eagerly awaiting starting matriculation at the National University of Singapore, where I will be double-majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computing. I am interested in exploring the rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and quantum computing! 

# 🤸‍♀️ What I'm currently up to
- Building at least 1 website application that can actually make a positive impact on someone's life 💪
- Exploring the details and workings of all the applications of AI by looking into Nvidia 👀
- Understanding quantum programming language and how to build, edit and invoke a quantum circuit through an open-source SDK (Qiskit) 🤔

# 🐧 Fun fact: 
When I started, I was most excited to learn LinuxOS. Hence, it is one of the first things I learnt in computing.
