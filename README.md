<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Linus Cheng</h1> 

# 🤖 💻 About Me:
I am a young engineer, eagerly awaiting matriculation at the National University of Singapore, where I will be double-majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computing. I am excited about rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and quantum computing! 

# 🤸‍♀️ What I am currently up to:
- Building website applications that make a positive impact on anyone's life 💪
- Exploring the details and workings of all the applications of AI by looking into Nvidia 👀
- Understanding quantum programming language and how to build, edit and invoke a quantum circuit through an open-source SDK (Qiskit) 🤔
